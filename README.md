# American Gem Trade Association Source Directory Scraper
We'll scrape the [AGTA Directory](https://agta.org/directory/) so that we can make a gem/jewelry CRM. 
The directory is actually an iframe to the 
[AGTA Source Directory](https://www.members.agta.org/assnfe/companysearch.asp), which is where 
we'll scrape from. Pressing search without any input into the fields returns the full list of 
participants (~986 as of 04/12/2020).

## Disclaimer
This is a proof-of-concept only. Not intended for regular production use. The results are validated
but some manual crafting was required.
